## Title :  V-Learn - Visualizing Data Structures and Algorithms through Animations

<p style="text-align:justify">This project addresses the inherent challenges students face in comprehending data structures and algorithms, pivotal concepts in computer science and information technology. Recognizing the difficulties students encounter in learning and grasping these fundamental principles, our focus is on developing an innovative tool that leverages user-interactive animations. Unlike existing online tools that offer prebuilt animations, our approach aims to enhance understanding by providing step-by-step visualizations of data structure and algorithm operations.</p>

## The Concepts of Data Structure covered in project 

### Data Structures
1. Stack 
2. Queue
3. Singly LinkedList
4. Doubly LinkedList

### Sorting Algorithms
5. Bubble Sort
6. Merge Sort
7. Quick Sort
8. Insertion Sort
9. Selection Sort

### Expression Conversion Algorithms
10. infix to prefix , prefix to infix
11. infix to postfix , postfix to infix
12. prefix to postfix , postfix to prefix

## Aim of Project 

This project promotes E-learning.
1. To make it the easy job of teachers to teach data structure concepts.
2. To increase the understanding level of students in data structure concepts.
3. To increase the interest of students in data structure learning.
